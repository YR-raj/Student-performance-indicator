## ðŸ“ˆ Model Choice
Among all tested regression models, the best-performing model was **Ridge Regression**.  
The **second-best model was Linear Regression (RÂ² = 0.8797)**, which gave consistent and interpretable results.  
ðŸ‘‰ I chose to proceed with **Linear Regression** for further analysis and conclusions.

## âœ… Insights
- Student performance is **influenced by lunch type, race/ethnicity, and parental education level**.  
- **Females** have higher pass percentages and also score better on average.  
- Performance is **not strongly linked** to taking a test preparation course.  
- However, **completing** the preparation course shows some **positive effect** on scores.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Models were evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.  
- Further improvements may involve feature engineering, advanced regularization, or ensemble methods.
